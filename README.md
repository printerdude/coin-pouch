### MVP User Stories

#### MVP User Stories
- As a user, I want to search the name of an NFT collector from a drop down menu so I know what their current Eth balance is in their wallet .
- As a user, I want to see how much Eth I need to spend to complete a blockchain transaction in a slow, normal, or fast manner.
- As a user, I want to access the wallet information of a collector from my mobile phone so I can see wallet activity away from my desktop.

#### Post MVP Stretch Goals
- As a user, I want to compare different wallets at the same time to know who has more or less Eth in their wallet.
