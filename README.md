#### Post MVP Stretch Goals
- As a user, I want to see the twitter profile picture of the NFT collector when I am looking at their Eth balance so I can better recognize the owner of the wallet. 
- As a user, I want to compare different wallets at the same time to know who has more or less Eth in their wallet.
- As a user, I want to access the wallet information of a collector from my mobile phone so I can see wallet activity away from my desktop.
